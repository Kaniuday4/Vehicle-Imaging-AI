Installation
---------------------
The following modules will have to be installed in python3 before running the source code:

1. Tensorflow 2
2. Numpy
3. Cv2
4. Pillow
5. matplotlib

2. After successfully installing the requirements, google cloud credentials are required to run the OCR module.
3. Line 20 in OCR.py, change the json file to own google-cloud credentials file path.

Command to execute detection, masking and character recognition code - 

$ python3 detection.py -i inputs/<input_image> -m saved_model/saved_model ;python3 OCR.py

-i takes the input image parameter
-m takes the saved model .pb file which is the trained model file
